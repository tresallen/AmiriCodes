### Purpose

Why do you do what you do? What are your goals and the things you value? Where do you want to go?

### Pursuit

How are you chasing growth, knowledge, and opportunities? What is your level of hunger? If you had to choose to navigate certain goals ahead of others, what are you prioritizing?

### Process

With your goals and hunger now defined, how will you get where you want to go? What steps do you need to take in order to lead you in the right direction?

### Polish

After taking your steps, pause and evaluate. Where are you now compared to the path you laid out for yourself? Is it aligned with the 3 previous Pâ€™s? If you are not at your destination, keep going. If you are, how are you going to refine your process? Do you need to set new goals or do you need to refine what you have explored so far?
